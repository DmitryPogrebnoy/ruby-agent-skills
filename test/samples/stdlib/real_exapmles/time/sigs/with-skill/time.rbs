  # Returns the number of seconds the specified time zone differs from UTC.
  #
  # Numeric time zones that include minutes, such as `-10:00` or `+1330` will work,
  # as will simpler hour-only time zones like `-10` or `+13`.
  #
  # Textual time zones listed in ZoneOffset are also supported.
  #
  # If the time zone does not match any of the above, `zone_offset` will check
  # if the local time zone matches `zone`. Specifying a value for `year` will
  # change the year used to find the local time zone.
  #
  # Returns nil if unable to determine the offset.

  # If a block is given, the year described in `date` is converted by the block.
